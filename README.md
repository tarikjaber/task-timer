## Task Timer
This is a simple task timer web app that allows you to enter a list of tasks with their corresponding times, and it will keep track of the time remaining for each task and notify you when it's time to move on to the next task.

### Usage
To use this app, simply enter the task name and time in minutes at the end of the line after a space. For example,
"Task 1 5" will create a task named "Task 1" with a time of 5 minutes.

When a task is completed, the app will play a sound and display a notification with the name of the completed task and the name and time of the next task. The app will also update the page title with the name and time remaining for the current task.

If you need to add more tasks to the list while the timer is running, simply add them to the input field and press Shift + Enter to start the timer again.

You can also skip the current task with the skip button.
